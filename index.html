            <p class="discription">Michael Faraday was a British chemist and physicist born on September 22, 1791,
                 in Newington Butts, England.<br/>He belonged to a family of blacksmiths but went on to make
             significant contributions to the understanding of <br/>electromagnetism and electrochemistry. Faraday's inventions 
             and contributions include the discovery of <br/>electromagnetic induction, the formulation of Faraday's Law of Induction, 
             and the discovery of the laws of electrolysis.<br/> His main aim was to understand the fundamental principles of nature, 
             particularly in the fields of electricity and <br/>magnetism. Faraday's achievements are numerous, including being elected
              a Fellow of the Royal Society, winning the Copley <br/>Medal twice, and delivering influential lectures at the Royal Institution.
               His work laid the foundation for many subsequent <br/>scientific discoveries, including the development of electrical power 
               systems, radio communication, and medical imaging <br/>technologies.</p>
                 <h1 class="head3">Electricity and magnetism</h1> 
                 <p class="discription">Faraday is best known for his work on electricity and magnetism.
                  His first recorded experiment was the construction <br/>of a voltaic pile with seven British halfpenny coins,
                   stacked together with seven discs of sheet zinc, and<br/> six pieces of paper moistened with salt water.With this pile he passed the electric current through a
                    solution of sulfate of magnesia and succeeded in decomposing the chemical compound (recorded in first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812). </p>
